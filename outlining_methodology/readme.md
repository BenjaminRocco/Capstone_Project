1. Problem Statement
- What question or questions are you focused on answering?
- What is your expected outcome? (i.e. what will you be predicting or analyzing?)
- Can you use this problem statement to create a narrative or story that will guide your presentation?

2. Dataset(s)
- List dataset sources
- If working with multiple data sources/datasets, note how you will be combining them.
- Outline any cleaning or transformation steps you expect to take. Are any of these industry or subject-specific?
- Detail any requisite assumptions you need to check or transformations that must occur for the models you plan on applying. Be specific with which techniques you are interested in.

3. Modeling
- What is (are) your target(s)?
- Name at least 3 models that you could explore, given your target.
  - Are those supervised or unsupervised?
  - Do you have any expectations on performance? If so, why?
- What are some of the benefits and shortcomings of those models?
- Are there there assumptions about your target that must be met for those models? If yes, go back into section 1 and make note
  - Ex: Target must be normally distributed or normalized
  - Ex: X model may be greatly impacted by outliers, which would need to be removed
- Are there any assumptions to confirm or requisite steps to take with your independent variables for those models? If yes, go back into section 1 and make note.
  - Ex: Categorical features must be transformed to dummies
  - Ex: Text data must be cleaned, parsed, and transformed into vectors.
  - Ex: Distance-based models should have numeric features standardized.

4. Resources / References
- Gather any references and resources you are looking to use in your project.
- These can be related to the subject matter or methods you are looking to apply.
- Stick to verified resources such as peer-reviewed journals, government and educational platforms, and lauded industry experts.
- This section may not be filled out until further along in your project!
