# Rationale for Separating Articles by `Opinion` section versus `non-Opinion` section

Conventional wisdom would suggest that far more biased articles would be contained within the `Opinion` section of a publication, versus any other section. Therefore, for a binary classification model, we began by training a model that would be capable of identifying abstracts/headlines within the `Opinion` section of the New York Times versus any other section of the publication. This was the starting point of the project and allowed for a basis to be able to separate articles by varying degrees of bias and identify the most common words among the false positives/negatives of the model that eluded correct classification. The words were later included in a labeling function as `common misclassified words`.
