# Labeling Functions at a Glance

### Why Label Data? 

The simplest answer to this question would be that we would want to order our data in a certain way to make it easier to understand. In other words, there are many distinguishing features about our variables, but which boxes do these check that others do not? The way that we separate these objects necessitates clear labels so we can tell them apart from one another in order to draw conclusions through analysis about them.  

### What are Labeling Functions?

Labeling functions take data as input and as output return a certain number or letter that may be connected to a class or tier within a rating system.

### Labeling Functions in this Project

There are different characteristics of biased articles or media pieces that we can capture with labels. What is the general feeling that the author seeks to invoke from the reader? What words are chosen to inspire these feelings in the audience? How long are these abstracts and headlines of these articles or media pieces; in other words, do they tend to ramble on and captivate the reader through winding passages? These are factors in whether or not an article is biased and attempting to sway the public towards certain action or thought. Through the process of labeling abstracts/headlines, we gain further insights as to the degree of bias that these articles tend to contain. 

In this project, abstracts/headlines of New York Times articles are given a rating known as a Cohen Kappa score that rates the relative degree that a certain object exhibits certain characteristics. In this case, those characteristics are the amount of bias contained within the article and this is quantified by labeling functions! The score ranges from $0$ to $1$, with the following tiers: $0.0–0.20$ as "none to slight bias," $0.21–0.40$ as "fair bias," $0.41– 0.60$ as "moderate bias," $0.61–0.80$ as "substantial bias," $0.81–1.00$ as "perfectly bias." 

### Where else are These Functions Found? 

This is not unique to this project. In fact, we see labeling functions every day in our own lives. When we are asked about the level of satisfaction we have with a product or service, we are acting as an object and giving ourselves a number. When asked about the side effects we are experiencing when taking a certain medication, we are checking different boxes and are one sample of many different samplers with unique characteristics captured by labels. The list of examples goes on.
