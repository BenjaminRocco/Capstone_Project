# Summary of Findings

We present a novel web application capable of identifying the degree of bias within abstracts/headlines based on so-called “votes” from labeling functions. The user submits abstracts and headlines, the app scrubs them of common words and processes them for labeling by our “voters.” This cleaned abstract/headline pair is then fed into the voting system, and a bias score is returned. The user can then see how the votes were determined and whom was responsible for each vote.
